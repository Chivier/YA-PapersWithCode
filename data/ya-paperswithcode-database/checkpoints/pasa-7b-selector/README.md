# Mock Model: pasa-7b-selector

This is a mock model configuration for testing purposes only.

To use real AI functionality, you need to:
1. Obtain the actual pasa-7b-selector model files
2. Place them in this directory
3. Ensure the model files include:
   - pytorch_model.bin or model.safetensors
   - config.json
   - tokenizer files (tokenizer.json, tokenizer_config.json, etc.)

For now, the agent search will fall back to basic search without AI enhancement.
